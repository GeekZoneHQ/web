# Contributing

## Generally

Broadly, we follow the [Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).

We try to keep things super informal and simple at Geek.Zone. We have no "boss" and we encourage experimentation. We
believe that there is no such thing as a mistake, there are only learning opportunities. We have no restrictions on time
or geography.

We do ask that you follow our [Code of Conduct](https://geek.zone/code-of-conduct/).

## Special Considerations
We only have a few minor [directives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0B44OUTGXmg&t=47s).

### Workflow
- As per [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#tabs-or-spaces), we use [spaces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoOG6ZeyUI).
- Issues are prioritised with the [Eisenhower Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#The_Eisenhower_Method).
- We try to use the rebase and merge workflow.

### Naming

- PR & issue titles should be descriptive.
- Branches should be named<br />
  `[type]-[issue number]-[issue title]`
- Replace [illegal branch characters](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-check-ref-format) with `-`.

Branch type names are,

| type | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
|`feature` | Feature I'm adding or expanding| 
|`bug`|Bug fix or experiment|
|`junk`|Throwaway branch created to experiment|


## License

Geek.Zone is a member of the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/osi-affiliate-membership), so all our projects are published under GPLv3. You can find the full text of this in the `LICENSE` file. Any
contributions you make will be published under these provisions.

Side note: Even though the correct spelling is "licence", we use the USA spelling of `LICENSE` as this has become the
[defacto standard](https://xkcd.com/927/) in tech.
