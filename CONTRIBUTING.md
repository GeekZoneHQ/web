Only a few special considerations;
- We use [spaces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoOG6ZeyUI).
- Issues are prioritised with the [Eisenhower Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#The_Eisenhower_Method).
- Branches should be named<br />
  `feature-[issue number]`
- PRs should include<br />
  `resolves [issue number]`
- Add your name and contact details to `humans.txt` once your first PR has been merged if you want to.
- We try to use the rebase and merge workflow.
-  Geek.Zone members are invited to the Geek.Zone org on GitHub so that they can contribute directly. Membership only costs Â£1+donation each year so [join now](http://geek.zone/join)!

Otherwise, follow the [Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).
