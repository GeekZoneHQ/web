# Geek.Zone Web App
This application is currently intended as the minimum viable product for Geek.Zone members and n00bs to be able to manage their Geek.Zone membership. We will build it from there, but that's our target right now! We currently use a third party to do this, and while they are not a bad service per se, they do charge us for their services and do not do all the things we need them to do. Building it ourselves will not only mean that we get the system that we need, but also that those involved will learn new, transferrable skills and have some fun doing so.

Take a look at the original [spec doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c43e1wYHZhDdyiafeqodQPPd9sXDHv3pEtyxxVa64OI/edit?usp=sharing).

### Installing

Here's what to do to get this project up and running so that you can turn that sweet, sweet coffee in to sweet, sweet code.

1. Linux: `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade`. Windows: install [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).
1. Get the latest version of [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
1. Pip3 should come with python. Double check.
1. In a convenient, empty directory, run `git clone git@github.com:GeekZoneHQ/web.git`
1. [Create a virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) in that directory
1. Activate that virtual environment
1. Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
1. Check if you have already got [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/). Install it if not.


## Local Development

### Running the Tests

Simply run `python manage.py test`.

### Changing the CircleCI Build

We have found the [circleci local cli tool](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-cli/) to be very useful when making changes to the circle build locally. The errors can be a bit cryptic, but it's easier than debugging basic syntax issues from within the circleci console.
